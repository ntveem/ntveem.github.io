Welcome!

I am an Assistant Professor of Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). I work on a variety of topics in theoretical astrophysics, with an emphasis on gravitational-wave science and physical cosmology.

Prior to joining UCSB, I was a John Bahcall Fellow and member of the School of Natural Sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS).

I obtained my PhD in Physics at Caltech, where I worked with [Chris Hirata](https://physics.osu.edu/people/hirata.10).

On this website, you can find the details of my past and current [research topics]({{ '/research.html' | relative_url }}), my [publication list]({{ '/publications.html' | relative_url }}) and my [CV]({{ '/CV.html' | relative_url }}). If you are interested in learning more about my work, contact me at `teja@ucsb.edu` or see the full details on the [Contact page]({{ '/contact.html' | relative_url }}).
