<!--![Profile picture]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/images/Tejaswi_picture.jpg)-->

I am a member at the [School of Natural Sciences](http://www.sns.ias.edu/) at the Institute for Advanced Study. I work on a variety of topics in theoretical astrophysics, with an emphasis on physical cosmology. 

Prior to this, I was a graduate student in Physics at Caltech with [Chris Hirata](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~chirata/web/). 

On this website, you can find the details of my past and current [research topics]({{ BASE_PATH }}/research.html), my [publication list]({{ BASE_PATH }}/publications.html) and my [CV]({{ BASE_PATH }}/CV.html). If you are interested in learning more about my work, contact me at:

## Update Author Attributes

In `_config.yml` remember to specify your own data:
    
    title : My Blog =)
    
    author :
      name : Name Lastname
      email : blah@email.test
      github : username
      twitter : username

The theme should reference these variables whenever needed.
    
## Sample Posts

This blog contains sample posts which help stage pages and blog data.
When you don't need the samples anymore just delete the `_posts/core-samples` folder.

    $ rm -rf _posts/core-samples

Here's a sample "posts list".

<ul class="posts">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

## To-Do

This theme is still unfinished. If you'd like to be added as a contributor, [please fork](http://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap)!
We need to clean up the themes, make theme usage guides with theme-specific markup examples.-->
