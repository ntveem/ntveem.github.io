Welcome!

<!--![Profile picture]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/images/Tejaswi_picture.jpg)-->

I am an Assistant Professor of Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). I work on a variety of topics in theoretical astrophysics, with an emphasis on gravitational-wave science and physical cosmology.

Prior to joining UCSB, I was a John Bahcall Fellow and member of the School of Natural Sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS).

I obtained my PhD in Physics at Caltech, where I worked with [Chris Hirata](https://physics.osu.edu/people/hirata.10).

On this website, you can find the details of my past and current [research topics]({{ '/research.html' | relative_url }}), my [publication list]({{ '/publications.html' | relative_url }}) and my [CV]({{ '/CV.html' | relative_url }}). If you are interested in learning more about my work, contact me at `teja@ucsb.edu` or see the full details on the [Contact page]({{ '/contact.html' | relative_url }}).

## Update Author Attributes

In `_config.yml` remember to specify your own data:
    
    title : My Blog =)
    
    author :
      name : Name Lastname
      email : blah@email.test
      github : username
      twitter : username

The theme should reference these variables whenever needed.
    
## Sample Posts

This blog contains sample posts which help stage pages and blog data.
When you don't need the samples anymore just delete the `_posts/core-samples` folder.

    $ rm -rf _posts/core-samples

Here's a sample "posts list".

<ul class="posts">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

## To-Do

This theme is still unfinished. If you'd like to be added as a contributor, [please fork](http://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap)!
We need to clean up the themes, make theme usage guides with theme-specific markup examples.-->
