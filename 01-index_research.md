I work in theoretical astrophysics with an emphasis on gravitational-wave science and physical cosmology. I enjoy working on interesting theoretical problems while also developing scalable data-analysis methods to extract new physics from observations.

## Gravitational-Wave Astrophysics
I develop methods to detect and interpret gravitational-wave signals from compact binaries in current and next-generation detector data. These efforts span search pipelines, inference tools, and waveform modeling, with the goal of enhancing sensitivity while making analyses faster and more robust.

## Black-Hole Populations and Merger Demographics
I study binary black hole populations to infer how these systems are assembled and to place them in their broader astrophysical context. This requires population-level inference on gravitational-wave catalogs, together with careful treatment of selection effects and measurement uncertainties in the properties of individual candidate events.

## Strong Gravitational Lensing and Cosmography
I work on the use of strongly lensed systems of all kinds, including gravitational waves, as precision probes of cosmology and structure in the Universe. This includes methods to connect lensing observables in galaxy cluster systems to dark matter substructure, identify lensing signatures in gravitational-wave data, and extract cosmographic information from those signals.

## Neutron-Star and Compact-Object Physics
I investigate tidal effects in neutron-star binaries and their imprint on gravitational waveforms. Better understanding both the linear and nonlinear tidal regimes can expand what we learn about dense matter and relativistic dynamics from gravitational-wave observations.

## Early-Universe and Physical Cosmology
I work on problems in early-universe cosmology, including reionization-era physics, recombination-era effects, primordial magnetic fields, and dark-matter phenomenology. A common goal is to identify novel physical phenomena in the early Universe and determine how to probe them with cosmological and astrophysical observations.
