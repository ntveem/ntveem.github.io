I am interested in a variety of topics in theoretical astrophysics. Within this broad scope, I have focused primarily on physical cosmology. This area of inquiry concerns itself with the evolution of the large-scale universe from its initial state to the current one. I find it particularly rewarding to work on problems which involve ideas from several areas of physics.

So far, I have worked/am working on the following subjects:

<!--ul>
	{% assign pages_list = site.posts | sort:"imp" %}
	{% assign group = 'research_pages' %}
	{% include JB/pages_list %}
</ul-->

  * Reionization and the dark ages
  * Perturbed recombination
  * Tidal effects in neutron star binaries
  * Sterile neutrino production in the early universe
  * Evolution of cosmological perturbations
  * Strong gravitational lensing
  * Gravitational wave data analysis

<!--The links above lead to slightly detailed introductions to my work in each area. Alternatively, this page lists my work according to a semi-arbitrary system of tags, roughly corresponding to the physics involved in each.-->
